    "# Flatten 2D Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Design an iterator to flatten a 2D vector. It should support the next and hasNext operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the Vector2D class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector2D(int[][] vec) initializes the object with the 2D vector vec.\n",
    "next() returns the next element from the 2D vector and moves the pointer one step forward. You may assume that all the calls to next are valid.\n",
    "hasNext() returns true if there are still some elements in the vector, and false otherwise.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input\n",
    "[\"Vector2D\", \"next\", \"next\", \"next\", \"hasNext\", \"hasNext\", \"next\", \"hasNext\"]\n",
    "[[[[1, 2], [3], [4]]], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]\n",
    "Output\n",
    "[null, 1, 2, 3, true, true, 4, false]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "```\n",
    "Vector2D vector2D = new Vector2D([[1, 2], [3], [4]]);\n",
    "vector2D.next();    // return 1\n",
    "vector2D.next();    // return 2\n",
    "vector2D.next();    // return 3\n",
    "vector2D.hasNext(); // return True\n",
    "vector2D.hasNext(); // return True\n",
    "vector2D.next();    // return 4\n",
    "vector2D.hasNext(); // return False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 <= vec.length <= 200\n",
    "- 0 <= vec[i].length <= 500\n",
    "- -500 <= vec[i][j] <= 500\n",
    "- At most 105 calls will be made to next and hasNext.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Follow up:** As an added challenge, try to code it using only iterators in C++ or iterators in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint #1  \n",
    "- How many variables do you need to keep track?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint #2  \n",
    "- Two variables is all you need. Try with x and y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint #3  \n",
    "- Beware of empty rows. It could be the first few rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint #4  \n",
    "- To write correct code, think about the invariant to maintain. What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint #5  \n",
    "- The invariant is x and y must always point to a valid point in the 2d vector. Should you maintain your invariant ahead of time or right when you need it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint #6  \n",
    "- Not sure? Think about how you would implement hasNext(). Which is more complex?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint #7  \n",
    "- Common logic in two different places should be refactored into a common method."
